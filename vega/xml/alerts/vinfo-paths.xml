	Vega has detected a possible absolute filesystem path (i.e. one that is not relative to the web root). This information is sensitive, as it may reveal things about the server environment to an attacker. Knowing filesystem layout can increase the chances of success for blind attacks. Full system paths are very often found in error output. This output should never be sent to clients on production systems. It should be redirected to another output channel (such as an error log) for analysis by developers and system administrators.
