	<impact>Vega has detected a version control string in scanned content.</impact>
	<impact>These strings can contain developer usernames or reveal other sensitive information about the application.</impact>
	<impact>This information can be used to help make brute-force or other attacks more likely to succeed.</impact>

	<remediation>Developers should ensure that this information is not included in content that is deployed on production servers. These strings should be also removed from third-party static content if left there by the developer, as it unnecessarily aids application or patchlevel fingerprinting.</remediation>

	<discussion>
	Version control systems (VCSs) are tools for tracking changes to files over time. Some of these systems tag each file with a string indicating the current revision, the username, the last change, and a timestamp. This information may be sensitive and care should be taken that it not be inadvertently exposed on production servers exposed to potentially hostile clients.
