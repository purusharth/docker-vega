	<discussion>
	File uploads via FORM submissions are a common source of vulnerabilities. The most common attacks include uploading of script code (uploading a PHP file and then executing it remotely). Ensure that the location of the files uploaded is restricted, i.e., the uploaded file cannot be interpreted as server-side code. Care should also be taken to ensure that directory traversal vulnerabilities do not allow files to be uploaded in other areas.
