	<severity>Medium</severity>

        <impact>If a forward secret cipher is not used, the security of the session data is as secure as the server's long-term private key.</impact>

        <remediation>
                Server administrators should configure the server to prioritize forward secret cipher suites such as those using ECDHE (elliptic-curve DH ephemeral) and DHE (DH ephemeral).

                Mozilla has made guielines available for securely configuring TLS servers. See the references section for a link.
        </remediation>
        <remediation>
                The HTTPS server must likely be restarted for any configuration changes to take effect.

        <discussion>
                Vega detected that the server does not support or prioritize forward secret ciphers in the list of supported cipher suites.
                Forward secret ciphers use algorithms such as Diffie-Hellman ephemeral to generate a single-use session key. This key
                is not derived from the long-term private key, therefore the security of the data is not subject to decryption if that key
                is compromised in the future.
