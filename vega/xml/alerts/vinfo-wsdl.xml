	<discussion>WSDL (Web Services Description Language) is an XML document that describes web services. The description includes the connection details and available operations. Web services clients can interpret the WSDL to understand the available services and how to use them. A WSDL is of interest because it may expose web service operations where vulnerabilities can be present. In some environments, the WSDL definition itself may constitute an unacceptable exposure.
